Below are the changes I made as part of this CakeManager application;

1. Converted CakeManager application as a spring Boot application
2. Created APIs for Getting the all cakes, getting cake by cake id, Adding Cake deatils, Updating Cake deeatils and Deleting Cake
3. Separated controller, service and DAO layer
4. Implemented REST API end points for all CRUD operations of cake entity via any client like POSTMAN by using below url
    'http://localhost:8088/cakeEntities'
5. Used in-memory DB using H2 database and added all insert queries in data.sql file
6. Implemented Spring security which will give login screen and during login it will verify username and  encrypted password in
   'CAKEUSER' table.
